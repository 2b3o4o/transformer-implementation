This information might actually be more accessible in the parallelized versions since query/key/value matrices might have the same indexing relative to the original input (meaning for example that the 5th value vector and 5th query vector are both associated with the 5th input token). I think in this case I need to manually pass in the position of the query token, as an index of the key/value vectors. So passing in position 5 would mean that the query token also has the value vector on row 5 of the values matrix, and I can therefore mask every row of the values matrix after that. In the parallelized function I think this will look more like cutting out a diagonal slice of the scaled weights matrix."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# I assume all rows have the same dimension, which is provided in dim\n","# keys, values are assumed to be structured such that each key/value is a row.\n","# Of course, there must also be an equal number of keys and values, so those matrices must have equal dimensions\n","from numpy import Infinity\n","\n","\n","def attention(query: tensor, keys: tensor, values: tensor, dim: int, query_pos: int) -> tensor:\n","    # query = query.view(1, -1)\n","    raw_weights = query @ keys.T\n","\n","    # Masking:\n","    for i in range(query_pos + 1, len(raw_weights)):\n","        raw_weights[i] = -1 * Infinity\n","\n","    scale_factor = sqrt(dim)\n","    scaled_weights = softmax(raw_weights / scale_factor, dim=0)\n","\n","    scaled_values = scaled_weights.view(-1, 1) * values\n","    contextualized_value = torch.sum(scaled_values, 0)\n","\n","    return contextualized_value\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Simple test case that I did by hand.
